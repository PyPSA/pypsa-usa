,Unit,Values,Description
types,--,"Values should specify a `line type in PyPSA <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#line-types>`_. Keys should specify the corresponding voltage level (e.g. 220., 300. and 380. kV)",Specifies line types to assume for the different voltage levels of the TAMU Network.
s_max_pu,--,"Value in [0.,1.]",Correction factor for line capacities (`s_nom`) to approximate :math:`N-1` security and reserve capacity for reactive power flows
s_nom_max,MW,float,Global upper limit for the maximum capacity of each extendable line.
max_extension,MW,float,Upper limit for the extended capacity of each extendable line.
length_factor,--,float,Correction factor to account for the fact that buses are *not* connected by lines through air-line distance.
interface_transmission_limits, --, true or false, Activate the Interface Transmission Limits (ITL) zones limits.
transport_model,--,true or false,Converts model from DC PF to Transport Model by replacing lines with Links. Link p_nom value uses NARIS network. Must be used with n_clusters == minimum # of Clusters.
