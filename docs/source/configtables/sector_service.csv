,Unit,Values,Description
service_sector,,,Options when implementing the service sector (Residential and Commercial)
-- dynamic_costs,--,"bool {true, false}",Apply sector specific time varrying natural gas and heating fuel oil costs.
-- split_res_com,--,"bool {true, false}","Model the residential and commercial network seperatly, or aggregate into a single service sector. (Only False implemented)"
-- split_urban_rural,--,"bool {true, false}","Model the urban and rural areas seperatly within each sector, or aggregate into a single region. If aggregated, constraints on GSHP capacity are implemented based on population. "
-- split_space_water_heating,--,"bool {true, false}","Model space heat and water heat seperatly, or aggregate together. If aggregated, only space-heat technologyies are represented. "
-- brownfield,--,"bool {true, false}",Include brownfield end-use capacity
-- gas_connection,,,"Option on amount of area connected to the gas network. 1 represnets 100% of buildings connected, 0 represents 0% connected. "
