,Unit,Values,Description
conventional_carriers,--,"Any subset of {nuclear, oil, OCGT, CCGT, coal, geothermal, biomass}","List of conventional power plants to include in the model from ``resources/powerplants.csv``. If an included carrier is also listed in ``extendable_carriers``, the capacity is taken as a lower bound."
renewable_carriers,--,"Any subset of {solar, onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc, hydro}",List of renewable generators to include in the model.
voltage_simplified,kV,int,Voltage level to simplify network to in rule ``simplify_network``
gaslimit,MWhth,float or false,Global gas usage limit (Set False for development)
co2limit,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Cap on total annual system carbon dioxide emissions
co2base,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Reference value of total annual system carbon dioxide emissions if relative emission reduction target is specified in ``{opts}`` wildcard.
retirement, --,One of ``economic`` or ``technical``,"Sets the retirement method for converntional generators. If ``technical`` all generators ``p_nom_min`` are set to ``p_nom`` to prevent selling off of the asset. Retirements are then tracked in post-proccessing. If ``economic`` existing plants have their ``p_nom_min`` set as ``0``,  ``p_nom_max`` set to ``p_nom``,  and capital costs set to fixed costs. Generators with ``p_nom`` are then added to handle capacity expansion."""
,,,
operational_reserve:,,,Settings for reserve requirements following `GenX <https://genxproject.github.io/GenX.jl/stable/Model_Reference/core/#Operational-Reserves>`_
--activate,bool,true or false,Whether to take operational reserve requirements into account during optimisation
--epsilon_load,--,float,share of total load
--epsilon_vres,--,float,share of total renewable supply
--contingency,MW,float,fixed reserve capacity
,,,
max_hours:,,,
battery,h,float,Maximum state of charge capacity of the battery in terms of hours at full output capacity ``p_nom``. Cf. `PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#storage-unit>`_.
,,,
extendable_carriers:,,,
Generator,--,Any extendable carrier,"Defines existing or non-existing conventional and renewable power plants to be extendable during the optimization. Conventional generators can only be built/expanded where already existent today. If a listed conventional carrier is not included in the ``conventional_carriers`` list, the lower limit of the capacity expansion is set to 0."
Storage Unit,--,Any subset of {``battery``},Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Store,--,Any subset of {``battery``},Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Links,--,Any subset of {},Adds extendable linksat every connection where there are lines or HVDC links without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity. Hydrogen pipelines require hydrogen storage to be modelled as ``Store``.
,,,
demand:,,,
--profile,--,"One of {``efs``, ``eia``}",Datasource for electrical load data. ``EFS`` pulls future state level electrical demand data. ``EIA`` pulls historical balancing level electrical demand dataa.
--scale,--,"One of {``efs``, ``aeo``}, or a float",(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Used to scale the demand profile data. ``AEO`` will scale according to demand projections from the Annual Energy Outlook. ``EFS`` will scale according to growth rates from the Electrification Futures Study. Or can sclae according to a user defined value.
--disaggregation,--,One of {``pop``},Method to dissagreagate load data. ``pop`` will dissagregate based on population from Breakthrough Energy.
scenario:,,,
--efs_case,--,"One of {``reference``, ``medium``, ``high``}",(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Extracts EFS data according to level of adoption
--efs_speed,--,"One of {``slow``, ``moderate``, ``fast``}",(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Extracts EFS data according to speed of electrification
--aeo,--,One of the AEO scenarios `here <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/>`_,(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Scales future demand according to the AEO scenario
,,,
autarky,,,
--enable,bool,``true`` or ``false``,Require each node to be autarkic by removing all lines and links.
--by_country,bool,``true`` or ``false``,Require each region to be autarkic by removing all cross-border lines and links. ``electricity: autarky`` must be enabled.
