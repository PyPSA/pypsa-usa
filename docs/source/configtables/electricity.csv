,Unit,Values,Description
conventional_carriers,--,"Any subset of {nuclear, oil, OCGT, CCGT, coal, geothermal, biomass}","List of conventional power plants to include in the model from ``resources/powerplants.csv``. If an included carrier is also listed in ``extendable_carriers``, the capacity is taken as a lower bound."
renewable_carriers,--,"Any subset of {solar, onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc, hydro}",List of renewable generators to include in the model.
voltage_simplified,kV,int,"Voltage level to simplify network to in rule ""simplify network"""
gaslimit,MWhth,float or false,Global gas usage limit (Set False for development)
co2limit,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Cap on total annual system carbon dioxide emissions
co2base,:math:`t_{CO_2-eq}/a`,float,Reference value of total annual system carbon dioxide emissions if relative emission reduction target is specified in ``{opts}`` wildcard.
,,,
max_hours:,,,
battery,h,float,Maximum state of charge capacity of the battery in terms of hours at full output capacity ``p_nom``. Cf. `PyPSA documentation <https://pypsa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/components.html#storage-unit>`_.
,,,
extendable_carriers:,,,
Generator,--,Any extendable carrier,"Defines existing or non-existing conventional and renewable power plants to be extendable during the optimization. Conventional generators can only be built/expanded where already existent today. If a listed conventional carrier is not included in the ``conventional_carriers`` list, the lower limit of the capacity expansion is set to 0."
Storage Unit,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Store,--,"Any subset of {'battery','H2'}",Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Links,--,Any subset of {'H2 pipeline'},Adds extendable links (H2 pipelines only) at every connection where there are lines or HVDC links without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity. Hydrogen pipelines require hydrogen storage to be modelled as ``Store``.
,,,
retirement, --," One of ""economic"" or ""technical"""," ""Sets the retirement method for converntional generators. If ``technical`` all generators ``p_nom_min`` are set to ``p_nom`` to prevent selling off of the asset. Retirements are then tracked in post-proccessing. If ``economic`` existing plants have their ``p_nom_min`` set as ``0``,  ``p_nom_max`` set to ``p_nom``,  and capital costs set to fixed costs. Generators with ``p_nom`` are then added to handle capacity expansion."""
