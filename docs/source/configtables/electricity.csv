,Unit,Values,Description
conventional_carriers,--,"Any subset of {nuclear, oil, OCGT, CCGT, coal, geothermal, biomass}","List of conventional power plants to include in the model from ``resources/powerplants.csv``. If an included carrier is also listed in ``extendable_carriers``, the capacity is taken as a lower bound."
renewable_carriers,--,"Any subset of {solar, onwind, offwind-ac, offwind-dc, hydro}",List of renewable generators to include in the model.
retirement, --,One of ``economic`` or ``technical``,"Sets the retirement method for converntional generators. If ``technical`` all generators ``p_nom_min`` are set to ``p_nom`` to prevent selling off of the asset. Retirements are then tracked in post-proccessing. If ``economic`` existing plants have their ``p_nom_min`` set as ``0``,  ``p_nom_max`` set to ``p_nom``,  and capital costs set to fixed costs. Generators with ``p_nom`` are then added to handle capacity expansion."""
,,,
operational_reserve:,,,Settings for reserve requirements following `GenX <https://genxproject.github.io/GenX.jl/stable/Model_Reference/core/#Operational-Reserves>`_
activate,bool,true or false,Whether to take operational reserve requirements into account during optimisation
epsilon_load,--,float,share of total load
epsilon_vres,--,float,share of total renewable supply
contingency,MW,float,fixed reserve capacity
,,,
extendable_carriers:,,,
Generator,--,Any extendable carrier,"Defines existing or non-existing conventional and renewable power plants to be extendable during the optimization. Conventional generators can only be built/expanded where already existent today. If a listed conventional carrier is not included in the ``conventional_carriers`` list, the lower limit of the capacity expansion is set to 0."
Storage Unit,--,Any subset of {``battery``},Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Store,--,Any subset of {``battery``},Adds extendable storage units (battery and/or hydrogen) at every node/bus after clustering without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity.
Links,--,Any subset of {},Adds extendable linksat every connection where there are lines or HVDC links without capacity limits and with zero initial capacity. Hydrogen pipelines require hydrogen storage to be modelled as ``Store``.
,,,
demand:,,,
profile,--,"One of {``efs``, ``eia``}",Datasource for electrical load data. ``EFS`` pulls future state level electrical demand data. ``EIA`` pulls historical balancing level electrical demand dataa.
scenario:,,,
-efs_case,--,"One of {``reference``, ``medium``, ``high``}",(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Extracts EFS data according to level of adoption
-efs_speed,--,"One of {``slow``, ``moderate``, ``fast``}",(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Extracts EFS data according to speed of electrification
-aeo,--,One of the AEO scenarios `here <https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/>`_,(UNDER DEVELOPMENT) Scales future demand according to the AEO scenario
,,,
demand_response:,,,Settings to activate and configure demand response
-shift,per_unit,"float {0 <=, >= 1} or 'inf'",Allowable load to be shifted per snapshot. Set to 0 to turn off demand response. Set to 'inf' to not enforce capacity limits.
-marginal_cost,$/MWh,float {0 <=},Cost to store one unit of energy for one hour
,,,
imports:,,,Configure electric imports from regions outside of model scope
-enable,,``true`` or ``false``,Enable electric imports
-costs,$/MWh,``true`` or ``false`` or ``float`` of ``carrier``,Cost of electric imports from regions outside of model scope. ``False`` will set cost to ``0``. ``True`` will pull in wholesales electric prices. ``float`` will assign a user specified value. ``carrier`` will take average marginal cost of the carrier..
-co2_emissions,CO2/MWh,``float``,CO2 emissions of electric imports from regions outside of model scope.
-capacity_limit,,``true`` or ``false``,Enable capacity limit for electric imports from regions outside of model scope
-volume_limit,percent,"float {0 <=, >= 100} or 'inf'",Volume limit for electric imports from regions outside of model scope (in % of total demand). Set to ``inf`` to not enforce volume limits.
-balancing_period,,``day`` or ``week`` or ``month`` or ``year``,Balancing period for electric imports from regions outside of model scope.
,,,
exports:,,,Configure electric exports to regions outside of model scope
-enable,,``true`` or ``false``,Enable electric exports
-costs,$/MWh,``true`` or ``false`` or ``float`` of ``carrier``,Cost of electric exports to regions outside of model scope. ``False`` will set cost to ``0``. ``True`` will pull in wholesales electric prices. ``float`` will assign a user specified value. ``carrier`` will take average marginal cost of the carrier..
-capacity_limit,,``true`` or ``false``,Enable capacity limit for electric exports to regions outside of model scope
-volume_limit,percent,"float {0 <=, >= 100} or 'inf'",Volume limit for electric exports to regions outside of model scope (in % of total demand). Set to ``inf`` to not enforce volume limits.
-balancing_period,,``day`` or ``week`` or ``month`` or ``year``,Balancing period for electric exports to regions outside of model scope.
