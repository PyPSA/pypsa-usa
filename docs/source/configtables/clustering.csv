simplify_network:,,,
weighting_strategy,str,"{population, demand-capacity}","When building multiple networks, Use 'population' if you want to ensure the clusters are assigned constant names."
to_substations,bool,"{true, false}",Implementation curerntly overrides to true. Network is simplified to substation nodes with positive or negative power injection.
