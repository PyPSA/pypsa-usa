,Unit,Values,Description
natural_gas,,,Options when implementing natural gas networks
-- imports,--,,Limits on imports compared to historical year
--- min,per_unit,"float {>=0}",Minimum import requirememnt compared to historical year.
--- max,per_unit,"float {>=0} or 'inf'",Maximum allowable imports compared to historical year.
-- exports,--,,Limits on exports compared to historical year
--- min,per_unit,"float {>=0}",Minimum export requirememnt compared to historical year.
--- max,per_unit,"float {>=0} or 'inf'",Maximum allowable exports compared to historical year.
-- cyclic_storage,--,"bool {true, false}",Apply cyclic storage constraints on linepack and underground storage
-- standing_loss,per_unit,"float {0 <=, >= 1}","Leakage rate from pipelines. These leaks do NOT account towards emissions, just enforces gas production to replinish losses with cyclic constraints. "
,,,
methane,,,Options of methane emission accounting attached to natural gas networks
-- upstream_leakage_rate,per_unit,"float {0 <=, >= 1}",Upstream per_unit leakage rate of natural gas. Applied to gas processing facilities.
-- downstream_leakage_rate,per_unit,"float {0 <=, >= 1}",Downstream per_unit leakage rate of natural gas. Applied to all end-use technologies that use natural gas.
-- gwp,--,float,Global warming potential of methane. GWP of 1 represents same carbon intensity as burned natural gas.
