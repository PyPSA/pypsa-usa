``nH``; i.e. ``2H``-``6H``, Resample the time-resolution by averaging over every ``n`` snapshots, ``prepare_network``: `average_every_nhours() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L110>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L146>`__), In active use
``nSEG``; e.g. ``4380SEG``, Apply time series segmentation with `tsam <https://tsam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package to ``n`` adjacent snapshots of varying lengths based on capacity factors of varying renewables  hydro inflow and load., ``prepare_network``: apply_time_segmentation(),In active use
``REM``, Add regional carbon-dioxide emissions limits configured in ``electricity: regional_Co2_limits``. These can be specified in the file linked at ``electricity: regional_Co2_limits`` in the configuration. File defaults to ``repo_data/regional_co2_limits.csv``., ``prepare_network``: `add_co2limit() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L19>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L154>`__, In active use
``RPS``,Add Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) constraints to shares of generator production (MWh) per carrier for individual countries. Standards can be set for single carriers or groups of carriers. Each constraint can be designated for a specified planning horizon in multi-period models. Opts and path for portfolio_standards.csv must be defined, ``solve_network``, In active use
``PRM``,Adds Regional Capacity Reserve Margin (SAFE) Constraints for defined region- set to a percentage above peak demand level for which renewables and storage do not contribute to. , ``solve_network``,In active use
``Ep``, Add cost for a carbon-dioxide price configured in ``costs: emission_prices: co2`` to ``marginal_cost`` of generators (other emission types listed in ``network.carriers`` possible as well), ``prepare_network``: `add_emission_prices() <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L24>`_ and its `caller <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/blob/6b964540ed39d44079cdabddee8333f486d0cd63/scripts/prepare_network.py#L158>`__, In active use
``TCT``,"Add minimum or maximum levels of generator nominal capacity per carrier(s), per region(s), per investment horizon. Opts and path for technology_capacity_targets.csv must be defined", ``solve_network``, In active use
``CH4L``,"Add an overall absolute gas limit. If configured in ``electricity: gaslimit`` it is given in MWh thermal, if a float is appended, the overall gaslimit is assumed to be given in TWh thermal (e.g. ``CH4L200`` limits gas dispatch to 200 TWh termal)", ``prepare_network``: ``add_gaslimit()``, In active use
