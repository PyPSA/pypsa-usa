,Unit,Values,Description
cutout,--,"Should be a folder listed in the configuration
 ``atlite: cutouts:`` (e.g. '{interconnect}-2019-era5') or reference an existing folder
 in the directory ``cutouts``. Source module can be ERA5 or SARAH-2.",Specifies the directory where the relevant weather data ist stored that is specified at `atlite/cutouts` configuration. Both `sarah` and `era5` work.
resource,,,
method,--,Must be 'pv',A superordinate technology type.
panel,--,"One of {'Csi', 'CdTe', 'KANENA'} as defined in `atlite <https://github.com/PyPSA/atlite/tree/master/atlite/resources/solarpanel>`__",Specifies the solar panel technology and its characteristic attributes.
orientation,,,
slope,°,"Realistically any angle in [0., 90.]",Specifies the tilt angle (or slope) of the solar panel. A slope of zero corresponds to the face of the panel aiming directly overhead. A positive tilt angle steers the panel towards the equator.
azimuth,°,"Any angle in [0., 360.]",Specifies the `azimuth` orientation of the solar panel. South corresponds to 180.°.
capacity_per_sqkm,:math:`MW/km^2`,float,Allowable density of solar panel placement.
correction_factor,--,float,A correction factor for the capacity factor (availability) time series.
corine,--,Any subset of the Copornicus Land Cover code list (see assumptions).,Specifies areas according to Land Cover codes which are generally eligible for wind turbine placement.
natura,bool,"{true, false}",Switch to exclude Protected Planet natural protection areas. Area is excluded if ``true``.
potential,--,"One of {'simple', 'conservative'}",Method to compute the maximal installable potential for a node; confer :ref:`renewableprofiles`
clip_p_max_pu,p.u.,float,To avoid too small values in the renewables` per-unit availability time series values below this threshold are set to zero.
excluder_resolution,m,float,Resolution on which to perform geographical elibility analysis.
