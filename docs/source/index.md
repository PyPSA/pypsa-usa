# PyPSA-USA

PyPSA-USA is an open-source energy system dataset and modeling tool designed for expansion planning and operational simulations across the United States.

PyPSA-USA provides a versatile toolkit that allows you to customize both the **data** and **policy constraints** of your energy system planning model with ease. Through a straightforward configuration file, you can control the spatial, temporal, and operational resolution of your model, using access to cleaned and prepared historical and forecasted data.

You can create and export the power system data model to use in your own homebrewed optimization model OR use the built-in PyPSA-USA optimization features to layer on additional policy and operational constraints. For planning studies, we've integrated data on regional Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), emissions constraints, and other state-level policy constraints. We're actively building this model so more features are on the way!

PyPSA-USA builds on and leverages the work of [PyPSA-EUR](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) developed by TU Berlin. PyPSA-USA is actively developed by the [INES Research Group](https://ines.stanford.edu) at Stanford University and the [Î”E+ Research Group](https://www.sfu.ca/see/research/delta-e.html) at Simon Fraser University.
