# PyPSA USA

```{warning}
**This model is under active development. The western interconnection is stable, however you are likely to find bugs in the workflow as we continue to develop the model. Please file [github issues](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-usa/issues) or email ktehranchi@stanford.edu or trevor_barnes@sfu.ca for support**
```

PyPSA-USA is an open-source power systems model of the transmission system in the United States. It is a highly configurable power systems model that can be used for capacity expansion modeling, production cost simulation, and power flow analysis. This workflow draws from the work of [pypsa-eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [pypsa-meets-earth](https://pypsa-earth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) projects.
