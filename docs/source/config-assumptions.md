# Assumptions

## Fuel Costs

As described in the `retrieve_cost_data` rule, state level monthly fuel costs are retrieved from the [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/ng/ng_pri_sum_dcu_nus_m.htm). In some cases, fuel cost data is not available or is withheld to avoid disclosure or individual company data. In these cases, the USA average is used to populate data for that state and/or month.
