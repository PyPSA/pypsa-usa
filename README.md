# PyPSA-USA: An Open-Source Energy System Optimization Model for the United States

## See our [readthedocs](https://pypsa-usa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation and usage instructions.

PyPSA-USA is an open-source power systems model of the bulk transmission systems in the United States. This workflow draws from the work of [pypsa-eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to build a highly configurable power systems model that can be used for capacity expansion modeling, production cost simulation, and power flow analysis.
