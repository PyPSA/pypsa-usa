PyPSA-USA is an open-source power systems model of the bulk transmission systems in the United States. This workflow draws from the work of [pypsa-eur](https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to build a highly configurable power systems model that can be used for capacity expansion modeling, production cost simulation, and power flow analysis.
